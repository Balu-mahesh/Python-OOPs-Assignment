The most important use case for __del__() is to ensure that external resources acquired by an object are properly released when the object is no longer needed. This includes closing file handles, releasing network connections, freeing up memory allocated by C extensions, or releasing locks. It is basically used to clean up resources before an object is removed from memory, closing files or network connections, releasing system resources etc. It acts as a finalizer, executing code just before an object is truly removed from memory by the garbage collector. This allows for any necessary last-minute actions or state saving."
